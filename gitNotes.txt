16.

b. git push origin -> To push the committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository on the default branch (usually main or master).
c. git push origin <branch_name> -> To push the committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository on the specified branch. If the branch does not exist on the remote, it will be created. This command does not automatically set the upstream tracking reference; use 'git push -u origin <branch_name>' to set upstream.

d. git reset <filename> -> To unstage a specific file from the staging area without discarding changes.
e. git reset . -> To unstage all files from the staging area without discarding changes.

NOTE : Use 'git reset --hard' with caution as it permanently discards changes. Use 'git reflog' to recover if needed.

19.
a. git rebase <branch_name> -> To reapply the current branch commits on top of another branch, creating a linear commit history.
b. git rebase -i HEAD~3 -> To perform an interactive rebase on the last 3 commits, allowing you to modify, squash, or reorder commits.
c. git rebase --continue -> To continue an interactive rebase after resolving conflicts or making changes.
d. git rebase --abort -> To cancel an ongoing rebase and return to the original state.

NOTE : Avoid rebasing branches that have been pushed to the remote repository, as it rewrites commit history and can cause issues for other collaborators.

20. Rarely Used Command:
a. git reflog -> To view the reference log, which records updates to the tip of branches and other references in the repository, allowing you to recover lost commits or branches.
